# Readme

This gradle project has a group of gradle tasks called "Demos", and each one will run one GUI demo class. This is probably not a good way to set it up, but it's working for now.

## Changes from the original:

- It's a gradle project now
- Gradle tasks that run each demo class
- Added images for the tic tac toe board
- Changed the package to `bsu.comp152`
- Changed the image files from `"file:imageName.ext"` to just `"imageName.ext"` since the former wasn't working
